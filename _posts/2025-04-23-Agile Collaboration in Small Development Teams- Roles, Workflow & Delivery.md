# Agile Collaboration in Small Development Teams: Roles, Workflow & Delivery

> Based on my experience at iFlytek and various international projects, this article summarizes how a typical ‚Äúsmall but mighty‚Äù agile development team can collaborate efficiently across the full lifecycle‚Äîfrom initial scoping to long-term maintenance. This model is especially relevant for people-focused, custom-oriented teams like Sunny Side Up.

## üå± End-to-End Workflow Overview

A typical agile cycle in a small development team is usually divided into the following five stages:

1. Requirement Gathering & Clarification  
2. Concept Design & Solution Planning  
3. Modular Development & Iterative Building  
4. Testing, Feedback & Client Review  
5. Deployment & Ongoing Support

## üë• Key Roles & Responsibilities by Stage

| Stage                | Roles                        | Inputs                                       | Tasks                                                | Outputs                                         |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Requirement Analysis| Client, Product, Developer    | Initial business scenarios, feedback, past cases | Identify pain points, clarify scope, build abstract model | MVP list, flowcharts, use case diagrams         |
| Concept Design      | Product, Architect, Developer | MVP specs, technical constraints              | Module breakdown, tech stack selection, system modeling | Wireframes, ER diagrams, system architecture    |
| Development         | Full Stack, Frontend, Backend | Design docs, user stories, sprint plans       | Coding, API integration, component development       | Working feature modules, commits, pull requests |
| Testing & Feedback  | QA, Developer, Client         | Feature build, test plans                     | Functional testing, bug triage, demo to client       | Bug reports, feedback summary, fix requests     |
| Deployment & Ops    | DevOps, Developer             | Deployable package, environment config        | CI/CD deployment, validation, production release     | Live system, deployment logs, ops documentation |

## üîÑ Role Collaboration & Handshake Logic

### Product ‚Üî Developer
- **Pre-work alignment**: Every feature has clear purpose, user, context, and boundary.
- **Collaborative outputs**: User stories, flowcharts, and wireframes bridge the understanding gap.
- **Ongoing alignment**: Product team joins iteration reviews to correct direction early.

### Frontend ‚Üî Backend
- **API-first agreement**: Interfaces are defined before implementation to prevent blocking.
- **Mock support**: Frontend can use mock APIs to begin early when backend is not ready.
- **Component reuse**: Establish UI library + consistent API return formats.

### Developer ‚Üî Client
- **Visual iterations**: Every sprint delivers something usable and demo-able.
- **Two-way feedback**: Developers not only receive but proactively give suggestions.
- **Co-testing before go-live**: UAT is done with the client to ensure alignment.

## üöÄ How to Keep a Small Agile Team Running Smoothly

### ‚úÖ 1. Flexible Roles, Clear Ownership
- Small teams don‚Äôt rely on titles ‚Äî they rely on flexible roles;
- Everyone wears multiple hats, but every key function has a designated owner.

### ‚úÖ 2. Business-Driven Technical Design
- Always start with the *why* and the *business scenario*, not just tech details;
- Able to transform vague business intent into buildable technical plans.

### ‚úÖ 3. Fast Execution Methodologies
- **Plugin marketplaces** for functional modules;
- **API documentation** for function-level logic;
- **Breakpoints & step-through debugging** for complex call flows.

### ‚úÖ 4. Sprint-Driven Rhythm
- Work in weekly or biweekly sprints;
- Every review produces something usable;
- Continuous retrospective improves team rhythm and delivery velocity.

## üß† Final Thoughts

The beauty of a small agile team lies in being "small but strong." Each person is not just a job title ‚Äî they‚Äôre a multi-functional contributor. Only when every team member understands their role, inputs, outputs, and how to hand over work effectively across phases, can the team produce high-impact results with limited resources.

If you‚Äôre working in a fast-paced but lightweight project environment, I hope this framework gives you a clear and actionable collaboration model to build from.
