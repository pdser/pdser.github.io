Hi! I'm Quinn Chen who is a pragmatic problem-solver and collaborative team player, known for aligning clean, maintainable code with real-world business goals. With over a decade of hands-on experience in software development—ranging from backend architecture to frontend implementation—I bring a full-stack mindset and a deep respect for craftsmanship to every project.

Currently pursuing a Master's in Information Technology at WelTec in Wellington, I’m also actively applying my skills through freelance and part-time development work. I'm fluent in PHP, Java, and Python, comfortable with Linux environments, and experienced with relational databases like MySQL and Oracle. I enjoy working in agile teams, contributing to peer reviews, and continuously improving both the product and the process.

Whether building custom modules in Silverstripe, automating infrastructure workflows, or translating business needs into scalable solutions, I take ownership of what I build—and I never stop learning.

If you're a potential collaborator, recruiter, or fellow researcher, feel free to reach out. I'm currently open to internships and part-time roles in Wellington and nearby areas.
