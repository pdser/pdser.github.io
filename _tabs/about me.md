Hi! I'm **Kun Chen**, an IT professional with over 10 years of experience in software development and system architecture. I’m currently pursuing postgraduate studies in Information Technology at WelTec, New Zealand, focusing on **AI-assisted code generation** and **natural language interfaces**.

This blog is my personal space to share technical experiments, document my learning journey, and showcase my projects as I seek opportunities for an internship in the local tech industry.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new technologies.

- 🔧 Languages: Python, SQL, JavaScript  
- ☁️ Tools: Git, Docker, Linux, VS Code  
- 📚 Focus: AI, NLP, Prompt Engineering, NL2SQL
