## 🧬 Data-Driven Epidemic Control Platform

**Tech Stack:** MySQL · AnalyticDB for PG · DataX · Apache Superset · Custom ETL Pipelines  
**Role:** Project Lead & Data Platform Architect

This project aimed to enable responsive and precise epidemic management by integrating health code systems, contact tracing modules, and real-time reporting tools into a unified data governance platform.

The architecture was built around a centralized data warehouse, supporting both structured analytics and rapid decision-making at municipal levels.

> 🔍 Key Contributions:
> - Architected the platform’s data warehouse and real-time synchronization pipeline  
> - Led a multi-vendor team in building scalable ETL workflows using DataX  
> - Delivered interactive dashboards for key metrics with Apache Superset  
> - Owned project progress tracking, stakeholder communication, and delivery validation

## 🏙️ Unified Big Data Platform for Smart City Integration

**Tech Stack:** Oracle · Hadoop · JavaEE · Tomcat · ZooKeeper · Redis · IFLYMQ · Elasticsearch  
**Role:** System Integration Lead & Operations Coordinator

This city-scale infrastructure project consolidated heterogeneous government systems into a unified data exchange hub. Designed for high availability and service extensibility, the platform served as the foundation for future “Smart City” applications.

With a focus on SOA architecture and standardized protocols, the system enabled seamless data interoperability between departments, achieving long-term operational stability and regulatory compliance.

> 🔍 Key Contributions:
> - Spearheaded cross-agency integration and distributed deployment across 50+ VM nodes  
> - Defined data exchange protocols and ensured compliance with regional IT regulations  
> - Implemented cluster-level monitoring and fault-tolerant workflows using ZooKeeper  
> - Delivered Redis caching and Elasticsearch-based search modules for platform-level efficiency
